# CRUD Operations Summary

This document summarizes the CRUD operations created for Parents, Students, Fee Types, and Fee Management.

## Models Updated

All models have been updated to include the `school_id` foreign key:

1. **Parent** (`models/parent.py`) - Added school_id foreign key
2. **Student** (`models/student.py`) - Added school_id foreign key
3. **FeeType** (`models/fee_type.py`) - Added school_id foreign key
4. **FeeManagement** (`models/fee_management.py`) - Added school_id foreign key

## Schemas Created

1. **parent_schemas.py** - ParentCreate, ParentUpdate, ParentResponse, ParentBase
2. **student_schemas.py** - StudentCreate, StudentUpdate, StudentResponse, StudentBase
3. **fee_type_schemas.py** - FeeTypeCreate, FeeTypeUpdate, FeeTypeResponse, FeeTypeBase
4. **fee_management_schemas.py** - FeeManagementCreate, FeeManagementUpdate, FeeManagementResponse, FeeManagementBase

## Services Created

1. **parent_service.py** - ParentService with full CRUD operations
2. **student_service.py** - StudentService with full CRUD operations
3. **fee_type_service.py** - FeeTypeService with full CRUD operations
4. **fee_management_service.py** - FeeManagementService with full CRUD operations

## Routers Created

1. **parent_router.py** - /parents endpoints
2. **student_router.py** - /students endpoints
3. **fee_type_router.py** - /fee-types endpoints
4. **fee_management_router.py** - /fee-management endpoints

## API Endpoints

All endpoints follow the standard pattern:

### Parents (`/api/v1/parents/`)
- GET `/` - Get all parents (requires school_id query param)
- GET `/{parent_id}` - Get parent by ID (requires school_id query param)
- POST `/` - Create new parent
- PUT `/{parent_id}` - Update parent (requires school_id query param)
- DELETE `/{parent_id}` - Soft delete parent (requires school_id query param)

### Students (`/api/v1/students/`)
- GET `/` - Get all students (requires school_id query param)
- GET `/{student_id}` - Get student by ID (requires school_id query param)
- POST `/` - Create new student
- PUT `/{student_id}` - Update student (requires school_id query param)
- DELETE `/{student_id}` - Soft delete student (requires school_id query param)

### Fee Types (`/api/v1/fee-types/`)
- GET `/` - Get all fee types (requires school_id query param)
- GET `/{fee_type_id}` - Get fee type by ID (requires school_id query param)
- POST `/` - Create new fee type
- PUT `/{fee_type_id}` - Update fee type (requires school_id query param)
- DELETE `/{fee_type_id}` - Soft delete fee type (requires school_id query param)

### Fee Management (`/api/v1/fee-management/`)
- GET `/` - Get all fee records (requires school_id query param)
- GET `/{fee_id}` - Get fee by ID (requires school_id query param)
- POST `/` - Create new fee record
- PUT `/{fee_id}` - Update fee record (requires school_id query param)
- DELETE `/{fee_id}` - Soft delete fee record (requires school_id query param)

## Features

- **Redis Caching**: All GET operations are cached for better performance
- **Soft Delete**: All delete operations are soft deletes (sets is_deleted=True)
- **School Scoping**: All operations are scoped to a specific school
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints using Pydantic models

## Database Migration Needed

Since we added `school_id` foreign keys to all models, you'll need to create and run a migration:

```bash
cd /home/kwola/RealWordProjects/inkinki_smart_school/server
source venv/bin/activate
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add school_id to parents, students, fee_types, fee_management"
alembic upgrade head
```

## Testing

To test the new endpoints, use the FastAPI docs at:
- http://localhost:8000/docs

Or use curl:
```bash
# Get all parents for a school
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/parents/?school_id=<school_id>

# Create a new parent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/parents/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"school_id": "<school_id>", "mother_name": "Jane Doe", ...}'
```
